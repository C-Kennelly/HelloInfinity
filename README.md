# MoochKick
Finds players in a Spartan Company who haven't played an Arena or Warzone game in the last x days

Welcome to MoochKick!

I built this as a way to better understand what other developers would need to use Quartermaster, my C# webscraper.

MoochKick will let Spartan Company Officers find out which members of their Spartan Companies are no longer "active."

To use MoochKick, simply download the zip file "MoochKick 1.0.0.1 Installer," unzip it, and run the program.  
Alternatively, you can clone the repository, paste in your own developer's key in Main, and build the code directly.

It's a Windows-only command line project at this point, but I will eventually be turning this into a ASP.NET project and hosting it somewhere.
